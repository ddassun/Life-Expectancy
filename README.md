# Life-Expectancy
Factors Influencing Life Expectancy using Linear Regression.

Context:

There have been lot of studies undertaken in the past, on factors affecting life expectancy, considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates.

It was found that affect of immunization and human development index was not taken into account in the past.

Important immunization like Hepatitis B, Polio and Diphtheria will also be considered. In a nutshell, this case study will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well.

In this case study, we will use linear regression to see the effect of various factors on Life Expectancy.

Problem:

The data-set aims to answer the following key questions:

Does various predicting factors really affect the Life expectancy?

What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?

Should a country having a lower life expectancy value increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?

Do Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?

Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with a country's status (developing or developed), lifestyle, GDP, etc.

What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?

Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?

What is the impact of Immunization coverage (for various disease like Measles,Hepatitis B) on life Expectancy?
